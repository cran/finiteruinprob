\title{Computation of the probability of ruin within a finite time horizon}

\description{
In the \enc{Cram√©r}{Cramer}--Lundberg risk process perturbed by a Wiener
process, this packages provides approximations to the probability of ruin
within a finite time horizon.  Currently, there are three methods implemented:
The first one uses saddlepoint approximation (two variants are provided), the
second one uses importance sampling and the third one is based on the
simulation of a dual process.  This last method is not very accurate and only
given here for completeness.
